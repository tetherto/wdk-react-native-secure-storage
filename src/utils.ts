/**
 * Rate limiter storage (in-memory, per identifier)
 * 
 * **IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:**
 * 
 * This rate limiting is NOT redundant with OS-level protections. It provides
 * defense-in-depth security:
 * 
 * **OS-level protections (iOS/Android):**
 * - Protect the keychain/keystore item itself
 * - Lock out biometrics after device-level failures
 * - Require device PIN/password after too many biometric failures
 * 
 * **App-level rate limiting (this implementation):**
 * - Prevents the app from repeatedly calling authentication prompts
 * - Stops prompt spam even if each prompt has OS protections
 * - Provides consistent, predictable behavior across platforms
 * - Adds defense-in-depth security layer
 * 
 * **SHARED STATE ACROSS INSTANCES:**
 * 
 * This rate limiter Map is shared across ALL storage instances created by
 * `createSecureStorage()`. This means:
 * - Rate limiting is global, not per-instance
 * - All storage instances share the same rate limit state
 * - This is intentional and provides consistent security behavior
 * 
 * **IN-MEMORY RATE LIMITING:**
 * 
 * Rate limiting state is stored in memory and resets on app restart. This means:
 * - An attacker could potentially bypass rate limiting by restarting the app
 * - However, this is generally acceptable for mobile apps because:
 *   - Restarting requires user interaction (not easily automated)
 *   - The app is typically running in the foreground during authentication
 *   - The device itself provides additional security layers (device lock, biometrics)
 *   - OS-level protections still apply regardless of app restart
 * 
 * **Security Implications:**
 * - In-memory rate limiting: Prevents rapid-fire attempts within a session,
 *   but resets on app restart. Provides defense-in-depth on top of OS-level
 *   protections (keychain/keystore rate limiting).
 * - Persistent rate limiting: Would survive app restarts but requires
 *   additional secure storage operations and proper state management.
 * 
 * For most use cases, the current in-memory implementation provides adequate
 * security when combined with OS-level protections. For high-security scenarios
 * requiring persistent rate limiting, implement a wrapper that stores rate
 * limit state in secure storage.

 *

 * 
 * 3. **Read-Modify-Write Safety**: We calculate the new state before writing,

 *    operations might both read the same state and increment it, but this is
 *    acceptable - it means the rate limit might be slightly more lenient, not

 * 3. **Acceptability**: This is generally acceptable for keychain operations because:
 *    - Keychain operations are typically fast (< 1 second)
 *    - They are bounded in duration by the OS
 *    - The timeout is a safety mechanism, not a normal occurrence
 *    - React Native's single-threaded nature limits concurrent operations
 *
